# MrxBlasters
This is my first mod for NeoForge. It's still in development so with only one blaster for Creative Mode only. In future versions, a crafting recipe for the blaster will be added.

This mode adds blasters into the game
For now, this mod has only one blaster
## Features
- It soots instantly
- As projectiles is used lit arrows
- Shooting range is vary long (about 70 - 100 blocks)
- You don't need to have any projectiles in your inventory, the blaster works alone because the lit arrows are meant to evoke a laser (and laser is infinite)
